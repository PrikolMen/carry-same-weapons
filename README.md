# Carry Same Weapons!
(instead of picking up stupid ammos)

## Where is Lua code?
Written in [Yuescript](https://github.com/pigpigyyy/Yuescript), compiled Lua code can be found in [releases](https://github.com/PrikolMen/carry-same-weapons/releases), or you can compile it yourself using compiled [Yuescript Compiler](https://github.com/pigpigyyy/Yuescript/releases/latest).

An addon that allows players on the server to take additional weapons instead of replenishing ammo for the same weapon. It can be useful for teamplaying. For example, you can pick up two weapons and drop one to your friend. That's a real dream of CS players who want to save two AWPs after the end of a round.

`Does not work with c++ weapons, for example from hl2.`
